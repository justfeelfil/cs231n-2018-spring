In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

1) Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
2) Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.
3) Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
4) Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
5) Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
6) Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
7) Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier
8) Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
9) Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)
